# Project

Script to test Synapse connectivity endpoints and Ports needed
    - Check Windows HOST File entries
    - Check DNS configuration
    - Check name resolution for all possible endpoints used by Synapse
    - Check if ports needed are open (1433 / 1443 / 443)
    - Check Internet and Self Hosted IR proxy that change name resolution from local machine to proxy
    - To make this test it might open AD auth / MFA / to be able to make tests below (Connect-AzAccount -Subscription $SubscriptionID)
        - Make API test calls to apis like management.azure.com / https://WORKSPACE.dev.azuresynapse.net
        - Try to connect to SQL and SQLOndemand APIs using port 1433

## Execution

### Option 1
    - Open Powershell ISE
    - Copy and paste script (Synapse-TestConnection.ps1)
    - Change variables
      - $WorkspaceName = 'WORKSPACENAME' # Enter your Synapse Workspace name. Not FQDN just name
      - $SubscriptionID = 'de41dc76-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx'  # Subscription ID where Synapse Workspace is located
      - $DedicatedSQLPoolDBName = ''  # Add here DB name you are testing connection. If you keep it empty it will test connectivity agains master DB
      - $ServerlessPoolDBName = ''    # Add here DB name you are testing connection. If you keep it empty it will test connectivity agains master DB
      - $DisableAnonymousTelemetry = $false  # Set as $true if you don't want to send anonymous usage data to Microsoft
